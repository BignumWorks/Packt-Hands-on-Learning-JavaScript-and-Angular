Why do we need angular?
- so far we have seen and experienced that even small js apps can be extremely verbose in nature,
- moreover repo structure of your project has no convention/rules imposed which made making big enterprise level web apps quite painful.
- Hence with evolution of FE technologies need of frameworks that can take care of all the mundane boilerplate stuff was felt.

Angular is one of the example of several frameworks which tries to address similar problems.

What is Angular:
- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. 
- Angular lets you define componens for your various FE flow, essentially these components shall own one dedicated task in your app. 
    - This is extreamly helpful while coding big enterprise level apps.
- Angular also provide several interesting features like dependency injection, about which we will learn more in the coming course.

Set up:
- Install node and its package manager (npm ), please use npm version 6.10.X or above as angular works best with 6.10.x and above.
- Install angular cli util, this is one such example where angular help us eliminate the effort of writing boiler plate configs.
  - command: #npm install -g @angular/cli (if you face any issues while running this, please try to run it as root/admin user)
- Test corrent cli installation by typing ng command on terminal/cmd (should not give any errors)
- Now create a new project 
  - command: #ng new my-first-app
  
- run your first app
  - command #ng serve --open
  
  
  And there it is, your first angular app up and running.
